Lifecycle hooks:

the lifecycle hooks are the methods listed in the descriptions

1. Mounting phase
    Ocurrs when the component (and its children compoments) render completely, i.e.
    after the component is rendered completely, the method componentDidMount() {}
    is called


2. Updating phase:
    Ocurrs when new state or new props are in the component calling
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) { ... }

    where prevProps and prevState reference the previous state and previous
    state accordingly

    How react updates things?
        2 copies of the virtual DOM, compares and finally updates only the component
        that has changed

3. Unmounting phase:

    calls the method componentWillUnmount() {...} right before the component is 
    removed from the DOM

    in here we can clear any memory information fast before the component is removed
    completely from the DOM
